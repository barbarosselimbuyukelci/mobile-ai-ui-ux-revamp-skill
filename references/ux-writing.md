# UX Writing

## Voice

- Clear before clever
- Helpful before formal
- Confident without overclaiming
- Friendly without vague language

## Microcopy Rules

Buttons:

- Name the result, not the mechanism.

Errors:

- State what failed.
- State what to do next.

Success:

- Confirm outcome.
- Offer relevant next step.

## Explainability Language

When AI generates output, include:

- "What changed"
- "Why this was suggested"
- "How to adjust or override"

Keep reasoning understandable by non-experts.

## Tone

Use creative, bold expression in high-level narrative and delight moments.
Keep action labels and critical guidance literal and unambiguous.
