## 1. Explainable AI

Design implication:

- Always expose what the system generated, why, and how to correct it.
- Treat explainability as trust infrastructure, not optional copy.

## 2. Agentic UX Ecosystems

Design implication:

- Model agent roles, handoffs, and human intervention points explicitly.
- Prevent context loss during agent-to-agent transitions.

## 3. Dynamic Generated Interfaces

Design implication:

- Design constraints, safeguards, and evaluation criteria, not only fixed screens.
- Specify which parts may adapt and which must remain stable.

## 4. Voice Multimodal Interfaces

Design implication:

- Combine voice with touch and visual confirmation.
- Ensure every voice action is reviewable and editable.

## 5. Micro-Interactions As Language

Design implication:

- Use subtle feedback loops as first-class communication.
- Validate that motion supports confidence without distraction.

## 6. AR In Practical Workflows

Design implication:

- Prioritize reliability and utility over novelty.
- Define onboarding and fallback for non-AR contexts.

## 7. Personalization With Boundaries

Design implication:

- Give users control over adaptation depth.
- Make data usage and privacy controls visible and understandable.

## 8. Accessibility As Foundation

Design implication:

- Start with inclusive assumptions in early concepts.
- Treat cognitive accessibility as part of baseline UX quality.

## 9. Cross-Platform Continuity

Design implication:

- Even when designing mobile-only screens, preserve continuity assumptions:
  resumable tasks, shared state, and handoff-ready context.

## 10. Passwordless And Biometrics

Design implication:

- Default flows should assume passkeys/biometrics as primary.
- Provide graceful migration for password-dependent users.

## How To Use In This Skill

For each project, map at least 3 relevant trends to concrete design choices and QA checks.
If a trend is not applicable, state why.
