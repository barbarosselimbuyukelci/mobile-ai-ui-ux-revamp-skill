# Visual System

## Typography

Define mobile text roles:

- Display
- Heading
- Subheading
- Body
- Caption
- Label

Keep hierarchy obvious at a glance.

## Color Roles

Define semantic roles before values:

- Surface
- Text-primary
- Text-secondary
- Accent
- Success
- Warning
- Danger
- Focus

Do not encode meaning by color alone.

## Spacing And Layout

Use a stable scale (example: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48).

- Keep related items grouped by proximity.
- Reserve dense layouts for high-frequency expert tasks.

## Motion

Use motion for communication, not decoration:

- 100 to 160ms for micro feedback
- 160 to 260ms for state transition
- 260 to 360ms for context shift

Support reduced-motion settings.

## Micro-Interaction Quality

Check:

- Is the response immediate?
- Is state change understandable?
- Is it subtle enough to avoid distraction?
- Does it increase confidence in the action result?
